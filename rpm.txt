Removing MySQL (only when it is installed)

I recommend to completely remove any old MySQL server versions that might be installed on the system and then upgrade to MariaDB without conflicts. 

To check whether MySQL is already installed, execute the command:

	rpm -qa 'mysql*'

If necessary, you can remove found MySQL packages before installing MariaDB by using the following commands:

	yum list installed | grep mysql

	yum remove mysql-client mysql-server mysql-common mysql-devel

And remove the MySQL databases:

	rm -Rf /var/lib/mysql
