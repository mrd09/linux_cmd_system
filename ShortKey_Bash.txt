*Special keys: Tab, Backspace, Enter, Esc

    Text Terminals send characters (bytes), not key strokes.
    Special keys such as Tab, Backspace, Enter and Esc are encoded as control characters.
    Control characters are not printable, they display in the terminal as ^ and are intended to have an effect on applications.

    Ctrl+I = Tab
    Ctrl+J = Newline
    Ctrl+M = Enter
    Ctrl+[ = Escape
