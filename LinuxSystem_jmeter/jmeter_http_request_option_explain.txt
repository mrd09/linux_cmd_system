####  Redirect Automatically vs  Follow Redirect

When you check Redirect Automatically option, JMeter will not consider redirect as separate HTTP request. This in turn may result as lower response time in your overall performance test.

Whereas Follow Redirect option will consider each redirection as separate requests. This may result in comparatively higher response time. This only has any effect if “Redirect Automatically” is not enabled.

To see the difference between these two, record a sample script and run it by checking Redirect Automatically and Follow Redirects option. The second option will generate more requests in your result listener.

#### 	Keep-alive 
- Keep-alive is an HTTP feature to keep a persistent connection between round trips, so that it does not initiate a new one on every single request. This feature has many benefits, but one of the trade-offs is that it holds resources on the server side and that can be an issue under heavy load.
