Block storage:
- Low level data store as 0 and 1
- harddrive store data in chunk of block


Hard drive =>	Block 1: 101010101010
				Block 2: 010011010101
				....


- OS(linux, windows) can combine the block together to create the file:
For ex: a.mpg, b.mp4

- OS dont understand the nature of the file or what in there => this left for application

- For easy locate file, OS store file at the filesystem


Object storage:
- Treat data as Object: has meta about the file, Has ID
- Store as flat structure: because treat file as an full object not like block storage => highly scalable
