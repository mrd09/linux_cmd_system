- In MySQL:
	'price' (apostrophes or quotes) is a string. It never changes, so the count is always 1.

	`price` (backtics) refers to the column price. So it could be more than 1.

- In Bash:
	'This is meaning literally like string' : "special characters"(\,*...) are passed over and multiple words are prevented from being split.
	`Command Substitution`
