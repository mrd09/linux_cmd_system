Method 1:
The best way to prompt for a confirmation to continue in a bash script is to use the read command (source):

read -p "Did you check the ls result? If yes I will continue to rm all? " -n 1 -r
echo    # (optional) move to a new line
if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then
    exit 1
fi

-n option to read to accept one character without the need to press Enter. You can use one or both of these.
-r		do not allow backslashes to escape any characters

Method 2: Should you this way:

   while true; do
    read -p "Did you check the ls result? If yes I will continue to rm all? ?" yn
    case $yn in
        [Yy]* ) rm -rf /castis/bin/CMSAdmin/cms/*;;
        [Nn]* ) exit;;
        * ) echo "Please answer yes or no.";;
    esac
   done
