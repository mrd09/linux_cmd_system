SHELL vs BASH
_______________________________________

*The shell	     + is a program that takes keyboard commands 
	     + and passes them to the operating system to carry out. 

*Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called BASH. 

The name “bash” is an acronym for “Bourne Again SHell”, a reference to the fact bash is an enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell program written by Steve Bourne

----Example----

[me@linuxbox ~]$
	This is called a shell prompt and it will appear whenever the shell is ready to accept input. 

it will usually include your username@machinename, followed by the current working directory
(more about that in a little bit) and a dollar sign.


If the last character of the prompt is a pound sign (“#”) rather than a $ sign, the terminal session has superuser privileges. 
=>> This means either we are logged in as the root user or we selected a terminal emulator that provides superuser (administrative) privilege

Terminal Emulators
_______________________________________

When using a graphical user interface, we need another program called a terminal emulator to interact with the shell

KDE uses konsole and GNOME uses gnome-terminal

=>> There are a number of other terminal emulators available for Linux, but they all basically do the same thing; give us access to the shell
