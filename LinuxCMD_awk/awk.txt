  awk "{print NF}": show how many column
  awk '{print $7}'	=> print out the value of the seventh column
  awk '!a[$0]++'	=> eliminate the duplicate value
	first
		 a[$0]
	we look at the value of a[$0] (array a with whole input line ($0) as key).
	If it does not exist ( ! is negation in test will eval to true)
		 !a[$0]
	we print the input line $0 (default action).

	Also, we add one ( ++ ) to a[$0], so next time !a[$0] will evaluate to false.

  awk '{print}' ORS=' '	=> Print the Output with Record Separator Variable
	=> in this example: seperate by space
