Changing special permissions

The octal value of the set uid bit is 4000. the set gid bit is 2000, and the sticky bit is 1000. These strange octal values aren't shown when you list them. Instead, the character representation is used. When using the chmod command

chmod u+s myfile

adds the setuid bit. The set group iD bit can be set using

chmod g+s myfile
To make a program set uid using the octal representaiton,the command would be

chmod 4755 program
