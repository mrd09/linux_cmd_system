How to see default UMASK?
just type umask and you will get the default UMASK
	umask

The minimum and maximum UMASK value for a folder is 000 and 777

The minimum and maximum UMASK value for a file is 000 and 666

Why 666 is the maximum value for a file?
This is because only scripts and binaries should have execute permissions, normal and regular files should have just read and write permissions. 
Directories require execute permissions for viewing the contents in it, so they can have 777 as permissions.
