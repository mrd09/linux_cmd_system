  :s/NAS/home\/dath\/NAS/g	=> search and replace in 1 line
	=> Explaination: want to add in head from /NAS_DIST01/ => /home/dath/NAS_DIST01/
  :%s/search/replace/g	=> Find each occurrence of 'search' (in all lines), and replace it with 'replace'.
  :%s/NAS/home\/dath\/NAS/g
	Substitution
	s:
	%s – specifies all lines. Specifying the range as ‘%’ means do substitution in the entire file.
	g – specifies all occurrences in the line. With the ‘g’ flag , you can make the whole line to be substituted. 
	If this ‘g’ flag is not used then only first occurrence in the line only will be substituted.
